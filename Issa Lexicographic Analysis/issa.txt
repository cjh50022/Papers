and roses
of Sharon

reaches the valley...

tire of them...

for the house

looks empty

too good for the house
they bloom

after cutting
the loofah vine...
strangers

how many days till you roll
down the mountain?




having a tumble
with the acorn...

fire is rising...

behind the wall
Echigo mountains




winter wind--
and the great temple hall
is ceiling-less

he lets the snow fall
colt in the pasture




falling snow--
yesterday it wasn't there
"House for Rent" sign




looking delicious

of the prayer to Buddha...

stuck in his winnow
chopsticks and a charm...
hailstones




a mirage running
and hiding...
withered fields

even on a boat, people
drinking away the year

on my hut's wall

are separated...

turns back to her children
turns back...




at Basho's grave
beginning with a prayer...

my place by the fire...

smolders...
little wood fire




my life alone--
all the way to Ryogoku Bridge
for medicine




after pufferfish soup
soon fans
are flitting




making a face
he turns down the pufferfish soup...
teaching the children




hey wren!
do you realize it's Ninth Month
30th day?




if I just whisper
the flock of plovers
bursts into flight




cold--
the withered grasses
with prickles




my gate--
just four or five radishes
in store




still I see them
how they were...
bare winter trees




an oak leaf this morning
fallen
in the tofu tub




borrowing the umbrella-hat
daffodil...
sleeping sparrow




daffodils wreathing
into the fence...

with zoni...

in the year's first dream
my home village...

and the willow
together trembling

while looking
at poppies, poppies...
a storm


1794

irises--
where that rainbow
starts from

in the dewy field
one sleeve cold...
morning sun

bad luck!
into the bonfire for the dead
a tiger moth

out of green leaves
then back in

has splashed the kite...
it seems

pounding the seven herbs
doesn't drown him out...
crow

spring peace--
after rain, a gang war
garden sparrows

spring rain--
one Buddhist sermon
two haiku

pilgrims on their way
to rites for the dead

in hazy night
stepping into water...
losing my way


1795

morning mist--
the castle's shutters
bang open


1795

at the gate
how many thousands of bushels
of far mist?


1795

drawing water
it's tepid...
nostalgia for olden times


1795

duckweed is first
to float...
rice-seedling bed


1795

when did they go?
all the swallows' nests
empty


1795

larks in the sky
people in the sea...
a holiday


1795

frogs sing, roosters sing
the east
turns light


1795

a butterfly my companion
through Nana Field
we wander


1795

lying down
with a visiting butterfly...
outer hot spring


1795

amid the white
of the whitebait

on boats

resigning himself
to this oceanless province...

wisteria in bloom--
voices of pilgrims
voices of birds


1795

when I open my paper door
a bright moon

for the plum blossom moon
I remove

1795

I view three masters
of the original style...
plum blossom inn


1795

there comes a time
even in blossoming Kyoto...
sick of it


1795

to my upturned face
as I pray, blossoms
drip down


1795

amid his grave's
blossoms I bow...
missing him


1795

distant mountain--
looking at the blossoms
then hurrying on my way

divine providence--
throughout Japan gods
guarding blossoms

peach blossoms and willow
decorate the eaves...
blossom viewing

turning 'round
just missing a pretty woman...
willow tree


1795

Fifth Month rain--

the cormorants stare
at them hard...

1795

also changing
into a summer robe...
my journey's lice


1795

my new summer robe
splashed by hot
purification water


1795

for the potted bamboo
and me...
cool air


1795

daybreak--
the rooster-less village
has a cuckoo!

the weary cormorant
sees off the cuckoo
in the sky


1795

temporary shrine--
acting like he owns it
a snail


1795

green plums--
the baddest of bad boys
bare-chested


1795

vast sky
vast earth
autumn passes too


1795

under dewy umbrella-hat
nodding off...
the dog barks!

to Gichu Temple
we run...

looking small...
mist

birds and people
creeping through...
cherry blossoms

birds on the lake
all start honking...
a cold night


1796

like the others
on tatami mats...
moon gazing

in falling snow
in straw sandals
leaving the inn

becoming a child
on New Year's Day...
I wish!

welcomes its falling...

my New Year's toast
with straw sandals on...
dawn


1798

from the nose
of the sudden riser...
mist


1798

watching rain fall
on the rice seedlings...
from the doorway


1798

crackling in the rainstorm--
field fires
mountain fires

amid mustard flowers
till the ten o'clock bell...
morning tea


1798

plum blossom moon--
descending the ladder
I see it


1798

this morning I'm one
of the pure-minded priests...
plum blossoms


1798

that temple bell
sounds like Ueno's...
clouds of blossoms


1798

the blossom clouds
over Mount Miwa...
pitch black


1798

cherry blossoms--
over there an edge
of Old Japan


1798

cherry blossom clouds--
over there an edge
of Old Japan


1798

in cool air
slicing the falling rain...
lightning!


1798

wind on the greenery--
a weary cloud
hangs over


1798

wind on the greenery--
coming to see my house
the morning sun


1798

in the thick weeds
same as yesterday...
fireflies


1798

while calling fireflies
crossing his profile...
a firefly


1798

in an alley
beating fleas off a mat...
a bright moon


1798

harvest moon--
when my heart's had its fill
it's dawn


1799

leaving now
is especially hard...
spring mist


1799

though Mount Obasute
is hateful...
pure water


1799

evening mountain--
how long will the cold wind
blast?


1799

by the hearth
last night, his smile
was farewell


1800

up to yesterday
I saw you every day...
New Year's herbs


1800

in the blossoms
calling to me clumsily...
a little bird


1800

it seems to wash
the summer mountains...
sunrise


1800

Katsushika--
mostly rice planters
on the ferry


1801

his lock is worthless
he's told...
plowing the rice field


1801

if my father were here--
dawn colors
over green fields


1801

wind shakes the bamboo grass--
mother deer
returns


1801

cuckoo--
today I'm in good spirits
too


1801

shooing flies too
today, as he sleeps
for the last time


1801

night after night
of pestering...
fleas, mosquitoes


1801

at my feet
when did you get here?
snail


1801

splashing me
the survivor...
grassy dew

alone, listening to
the evening rain

eye-catching
over the sunset mountain...
a kite

the hairdresser's
white wooden clogs...

1802

a river of broth
is steaming...

from the temple's
noon bath rising...
spring mist


1802

heat shimmers--
snow in the little thicket
winking


1802

ice melting--
in the threshold
early evening's moon


1802

behind me I hear
the Fox Festival...
Ueno Hill


1802

no Fox Festival ruckus
on this hill...
plum blossoms


1802

Fox Festival--
what village is this
in the mountain's nook?


1802

below the nightingale's
chin...
Awaji Island


1802

today they're flying
in the bathhouse town...
swallow swarm


1802

stopping to watch
the evening pines...
geese flying north


1802

darkening dusk--
in one nettle tree
croaking frogs


1802

a meadow butterfly
bombarded by big raindrops
from the eaves


1802

flecked with sand
from the whirlwind...
little butterfly


1802

rain shower--
yesterday at this time
meadow butterflies


1802

someone's draped them
over the azaleas...
bracken


1802

one branch makes
Kyoto's sky...
plum blossoms


1802

like old times--
plum blossoms here and there
evening's wooden drum


1802

cherry blossoms scatter--
the servant Taro
is relieved


1802

holding up
the hazy moon...
willow tree


1802

the main road
dry from drought...
midsummer


1802

pitter-patter rain--
a wild cormorant mother
cries on a branch


1802

from my bed
I peek outside...
new summer robes


1802

that one by itself
is my star...
Milky Way


1802

of willow

elsewhere

once again
I've managed not to die...
blossoming spring

my spring--
a bit of bamboo
and a willow sprig


1804

spring begins--
forty three years
fed by strangers


1804

spring begins--
in Yoshino the faces
of fools

without a shred
of pine decoration...

the pine saplings
over shoulder-high...
spring breeze

the mist wrecks my view
of the women

low tide
without pine trees...
lonelier still


1804

at Sumiyoshi
all through the low tide...
moon in the pine


1804

waited so long
for the low tide...
a driving rain

a house
with a rooster crowing...
low tide


1804

rain falling--
for the low tide gatherers at last

from the temple

toward the open mouth
of the nesting bird...

on the mountain

singing skylark
where is this poor village's
border?

even the field's
radishes are blooming...
the lark singing!

the lark sings
as it flies along...
Great Japan!


1804

my home village
no longer in sight...

evening rushes in--
someone on the tideland
a lark singing


1804

evening lark
don't let the field's smoke
annoy you


1804

mingling
with the thunder--
a pheasant's cry


1804

a pigeon cries--
even deep in the Thousand Islands
it's Buddha's world

celebrate the morning rain
then off you go!

1804

the last in line
hits the rain...
departing geese

departing geese
where will you moon-gaze
tomorrow?

the departing goose
stares the man
in the face

planning to fly north?
planning not to?

"My love
is at Mount Sarashina!"
the goose departs


1804

a lovely night lit
with oil lamps...

croaking frogs--
my first night
visiting this house

the kettle's soot
in his mouth and eyes...
croaking frog

another drop falls
from the twig

on a hurry-scurry
butterfly day
guarding the money

nervously
through the raindrops...

blown to the window
again

from a palanquin
at the lake, watching

in my hand...

violets on the gate--
even at night

1804

blooming violets--
some worthless grass
dug up too

before me
who also lived here
with these violets?


1804

clobbered every day
by raindrops from the eaves...
camellias

for the coast, camellias
blooming

in bloom...

if only for a day
to have my own house!

for whoever shows up

in plum blossoms

from Echigo

plum trees bloom
in full glory...
my broken inkstone


1804

and the rump
of a cow


1804

viewing plum blossoms
viewing blue sky...
but I'm in the sticks

also rambling
over the big field...

to a low place...

first pointing...

not very devoted
to blooming...

down-and-out plum tree
has bloomed!

eating my pickle
rind and all...

the home village
I abandoned...

made to wither
by the people of Edo's eyes...

blown to the big river
floating away...

blended in 
with people of Kyoto...

after blooming
they're roped off...
cherry blossoms

four, five, nine years
always the first to bloom...

the holy man
leaves them behind...

long as my sleeve...
in bloom

of good karma

an evening
of steady rainfall...
cherry blossoms

blocking my view!

half-hidden
in the rain shower...
cherry blossoms

cherry blossoms--
whichever side I sleep on
within hand's reach

Lucky the Toad, too
swaggers out...
peach blossoms

of calling fireflies

is clanging...

1804

all spattered
with bird poop...

1804

no one at home
to sleep with?
willow shade


1804

an evening spot
for calling fireflies...
planting a willow


1804

from where a fence
pens it in...
a willow

three strands or so
hide in the pine...

1804

looking at willows
and Toh Temple...

rise over the field...
eating rice balls

into the lake...

patting my belly
full of worms...

in soup kettle
and outhouse
the summer moon

pure water gushes--
looking at tomorrow's mountain
lying down

the moon shines
up to the pine...
pure water gushes

appears again

the hated grasses
rear their heads...

even trying on my summer kimono
lonely...

entering my ramshackle
hut you see...
a parasol

poops in the field...
parasol

moonlight enters
only through the window...

1804

after trying out
the twice-fired sake...

the field's too much
for one man alone...

dripping, dripping...

not worth the effort...
moon at the gate

a bamboo flute
Kamakura-style, rice planters
in umbrella-hats

his face older
than the pine...

even living
in Katsushika...
"cuckoo!"


1804

Sumida River
even more old-timey...
"cuckoo!"


1804

amid the thunder's
rumble...

1804

O reed thrush
which road is the dead end
of Kasai?

which way to ancient
Naniwa?

Matsushima
barely in sight...

from branches that block
the wind...

in the deep grass...

in solitude
walking on oyster shells...

I thought by now this journey
would've ended


1804

from the roof's overhang
three drops...
first autumn morning


1804

a cold morning--
but the same pine tree
as last year


1804

facing the gate
of elder brother...
a cold night


1804

a pounding pestle
completes the scene...
a cold night


1804

the field's smoke
crawls into my sleeves...
a cold night


1804

autumn evening--
from elsewhere another horse
neighs in reply


1804

even the pestle
becomes part of the scene...
a long night


1804

every time I go out
the horse neighs...
a long night

on a clear, rainless night
elsewhere!

with pale faces

watching the bridge
as evening falls...

on my pilgrimage
to which hell?

the little pine tree
puts on a show...

the river beach's pinks
barely visible


1804

when the fog clears
a mountain...
of fire chips


1804

from a hand that holds
a bucket of sacred branches...
fog rises

from a hand
pricked by sacred shikimi...
fog rises

even at a house
shrouded in mountain fog...
a festival

my dear one's house
behind it a field
of flowers

made of red paper...
for the ancestor

for the ancestors...

ends

its mouth open
waiting for spring?

in the bamboo

wrapped in the scent
of plum blossoms...

pass on

cherry blossoms--
I also hear a temple bell
from my twenties

in cherry blossom shade
there are even those
who hate this world


1806

from now on
cherry blossom solitude!
my window


1806

on Mount Ubasute
where the old were left to die...

most end up
stuck in mud...

in a thicket

in a cloudburst
another festival shrine
passes by

rainstorm--
hanging over the village
that doesn't pray


1806

rainstorm--
a wildflower blooms
at my pillow

only when a scrap of cloud
billows to form peaks...
then to bed

when I go back to sleep
it quickly forms peaks...
little cloud

for green rice fields

is mine

still hasn't starved
to death

on the big boat's mast
clinging

where the town's fireflies
hide out

in my thicket
at the end of their time...
fireflies

isn't

soon enough
for the murderer too...

may the gods grant
prosperity!

with no cards or letters

of a frog

with his umbrella...

"That was good thunder!"
he says


1807

cherry blossom clouds--
leaving Edo
tomorrow


1807

blossoming mountain--
even men who've knocked over Buddha
are here


1807

for the poor
there's not a spring
without blossoms!


1807

even in falling rain
satisfied faces...
blossom shade


1807

behind me a dog
growls his distrust...
cherry blossoms!


1807

bells and big drums
all stop...
cherry blossoms


1807

cherry blossom guard--
not much
of a Buddhist


1807

simply trust,
simply trust!
cherry blossoms in bloom


1807

the farm field too
is worth a look...
cherry blossoms


1807

in yellow roses
a great courtier's
thin kimono


1807

the village child
clutching the willow
sound asleep


1807

planting grass--
the nights are growing
shorter


1807

short summer night--
this morning on my pillow
dewdrops


1807

Fifth Month rain--
the crow scorns
my thatched house


1807

Fifth Month rain--
they watch from two houses
wildflowers


1807

looking again
looking again...
someone else's green field


1807

the sky colors
of dawn have changed
to summer clothes


1807

every time I put on
the summer kimono...
feel old


1807

such a moon!
yet he's under his fan
asleep


1807

the rivers have
an ancient darkness...
cuckoo


1807

cuckoo--
since you're in Kyoto
look at that moon!


1807

cuckoo--
this year again, nothing
but weeds


1807

the cuckoo's becoming
a regular...
moonlit night


1807

making the nightingale
reach old age...
my thatched hut


1807

my fence where the nightingale
comes to sleep...
it too is old


1807

is my wrinkled hand
bad for walking?
first firefly


1807

while I'm gone
you and the nightingale are in charge
my snail


1807

fresh green leaves
blowing, blowing...
where I lie


1807

Echigo mountains--
a chill runs up
my spine


1807

a chill runs up
my spine...
Echigo mountains


1807

autumn chill--
my spine feels
the mottled mountain


1807

autumn evening--
this is nothing like
my home village


1807

departing clouds--
"Autumn won't return"
the cicadas sing


1807

a glimpse of moon
over my home village...
then clouds


1807

even the moon
over my home village...
brings tears


1807

bright moon--
in a little thicket too
a festival!


1807

mountain fog--
the beautiful voice
of the dung-hauler


1807

does it delight
the village child?
bell for the ancestors


1807

on the ancestors' altar
without fail
a lucky wind blows


1807

you saw the bonfires
for the dead?
mountain rain


1807

now and then
a pine breeze...
sumo wrestler


1807

avoiding the wildflowers
he squats...
sumo champion


1807

the sumo wrestler
and the pine
grow old together


1807

a little party
in the red leaves...
mountain deer


1807

the hoe's a curse
I'm thinking tonight...
wild geese calling


1807

pulling shut
the window covers...
geese honking


1807

in the grassy meadow
how l-o-n-g you are!
red dragonfly


1807

people call it
the "Buckwheat Place"
red dragonfly


1807

the dragonfly's redness--
chased away
by people


1807

the dragonfly's tail, too
day by day
grows old


1807

from the eaves
one by one...
wildflowers


1807

blooming better
and better!
the festival chrysanthemum


1807

watered by
the village dog...
chrysanthemum


1807

snow country's
humongous morning-glories
have bloomed!


1807

down and dirty
just as is...
bush clover blooms


1807

after blooming day
twining 'round my legs...
bush clover


1807

barren bush clover--
softly, softly its blooms
have scattered


1807

the little crow
also weeps for joy...
heads of rice


1807

the young buck
wipes his wet nose...
autumn leaves


1807

drawing near them
a sudden loneliness...
autumn leaves


1807

before people do
herons raise a clamor
"Ice!"


1807

the year ends--
how long will that turtle
hang there?


1807

winter storm, winter wind--
the cow's sweat
blown away


1807

in winter wind
the pig giggles
in his sleep


1807

from the deep heart
of Shinano
snow is falling


1807

sleeping side by side
Shinano's mountains too...
evening snow


1807

snowy day--
people of my village too
unwelcoming


1807

first frost--
what are you praying for
katydid?


1807

my grave too
will soon need his prayer...
a monk beats his bowl


1807

sweeping soot--
even the sparrow's bed
in the thicket


1807

grumble, grumble
the pigeon nags...
no gift of new clothes


1807

the pines of Takasago
laughing...
the year's last day


1807

looking pitiful
in the blighted tree...
a skullcap


1807

today too, today too
bamboo viewing...
wooden brazier


1807

paying no heed
that spring is coming...
the wood fire


1807

even holy Jizo
is looking older...
fallen leaves


1807

for the nightingale
one is a hat...
red leaves


1807

the crow
is thinking, "There's always
tomorrow!"


1808

ah well
the road is wretched...
year's first day

a shiny-new year
has come again...
for my lice

First Month--
at the cat's grave too
plum blossoms


1808

First Month--
in a nook of the village
plum blossoms!

a long First Month
creeps by


1808

stand of trees--
even from poor grasses
flowering spring


1808

the wild daisies
are celebrating...
spring's first day


1808

a new spring
and a monkey!
viewed through my cuff


1808

spring's begun--
the sky over my house too
like old times


1808

while I slept
the plum tree bloomed!
lucky direction walk


1808

those plum blossoms too
must trust...
lowering the basket


1808

on the homecoming servant's
face too...
plum blossoms


1808

on the Servants' Holiday
there's no hiding
the white hair


1808

on the first day of Rat
picking a pine tree


1808

stockpiling rice
for Little New Year's...
little nook of spring


1808

out of place
with the New Year's pine...
my house


1808

putting on my
New Year's clothes...
the mountain owl laughs


1808

New Year's water--
an unfortunate soul
ladles it


1808

begging actors--
the olden times return
today


1808

now it's a springtime
befitting old men...

1808

spring day--
the outhouse sandals
are new

the nightingale's
throat is parched...
a long day

roly-poly pigeons
growing fatter...
a long day


1808

from whence will spring's dusk
come?

is a treasure

to my dinner tray
evening's spring breeze
comes wafting

with sand in his hair

a precious harp
a beggar's flute
deep in mist


1808

a poorly played flute
faintly, faintly...
spring mist


1808

heat shimmers rise
even from my hand's
wrinkles!


1808

heat shimmers--
tomorrow's sake price
on a little brushwood fence


1808

heat shimmers--
yesterday it sang
pond snail shell


1808

heat shimmers--
someone listening to
a snail shell


1808

by Doll Festival time
not a decent cherry tree
blooming anywhere

creep along with it...
low tide


1808

some stay behind
in the barley...
low tide crows


1808

the nightingale, too
has a merry song...
tea pickers


1808

even bird-eating birds
lose their nests
in the burning grass


1808

the butterfly sleeps--
until the burning field's smoke
covers it


1808

giving shade
for the farmer's plowing...
plum blossoms

just hearing a nightingale
is enough...

watching me
with a grumpy face...

getting used to this blanket
of plum blossom scent...

tucked into folds
of plum blossom scent
I sleep

from deep inside
the pretty flower...

a "Praise Buddha!"
pops to my lips...
mushrooms

despised
by the barrier guard...

for this homeless body
of mine, spring's
first day

is sweet

grew up fast


1809

in the mop's
drying place...
my New Year's pine


1809

making charcoal balls
one by one...
a long day

is nagging

snow melting--
for sparrows at the gate
good as a harvest moon!

of the migrating servants!"

in the evening...
threshing tea leaves

chasing the crow
ten or twelve yards...

accompanying the rain
with its tail...

where the stray cat carouses
in bloom

with sacred sake

down


1809

cherry blossoms scatter--
bad Buddhists
carousing


1809

cherry blossoms!
country nightingales

one cherry tree
has kept blooming...
the corrupt world

a windy place!
but one cherry tree
in bloom

fifty years
of gazing, gazing...
cherry blossoms

in a Sumiyoshi nook
blooming
cherry blossoms

the old cherry tree
blooming
till it drops

in all 88
sacred sites

my mean peach tree
nice and chubby
with blossoms

peach tree in bloom--
but first a prayer
for the dewy barley


1809

green willows--
at ten different holes
gamblers tossing pennies


1809

rustling
in Goddess Kannon's heart...
the willow


1809

planting a willow--

beyond the gate...
willow tree

under the cloudburst
standing tall...
lamps in the grove

in the cloudburst
there's not a gate
without a pink

every evening
"Rain is coming!"
cloud watchers


1809

strolls through

flows


1809

raising it for
my summer seclusion's view...
little pine


1809

a praying mantis
at the base of Mount Fuji
clings


1809

it's Mount Fuji's grass
but no trace
of cool air


1809

no Mount Fuji
I can almost straddle
this year


1809

let's thatch with irises--
Mount Asama's smoke
looks calm


1809

swallows return
on the day eaves are thatched
with irises


1809

from the mountain
I see my own gate...

tomorrow night and the next
the same?
in my mosquito net, alone

stopping to count
my mosquito net's holes...
sickle moon


1809

high noon--
inside the mosquito net
wildflowers blooming


1809

stroke victim--
even holding a paper fan
an ordeal


1809

smoking out mosquitoes--
soon the fireflies
are gone too


1809

veiling the face
of the evening moon...

and three or four
fireflies

a softly blowing
world-improving breeze...
fireflies flit


1809

into my pitiful kettle
one by one...
fireflies


1809

"Come, fireflies!"
a single stalk of bamboo
makes my night

gapes

in the peonies
here and there

of new bamboo...

1810

grateful
for the summer kimono
evening dew


1810

soft-blowing grasses
and soft, soft
green bamboo blind


1810

green yesterday
in the blowing wind...
bamboo blind


1810

empty boat--
three herons guard
the mosquito net


1810

O owl
don't tell the world my house
has no mosquito net!


1810

evening falls--
on the tip of my fan
Mount Asama


1810

smoke from the mountain--
my paper fan
speeds it along


1810

pretty--
beyond the smudge pot smoke
Sumida River


1810

rushing into
the smudge pot smoke...
evening crow


1810

in grasses' shade
where soon I'll enter...
evening cool


1810

back gate--
under the big nettle tree
nobody cooling off


1810

the empty purse
floats away...
evening cool


1810

tea smoke--
Buddha's little rice field
is planted too


1810

following behind
the hunter with his bow...
a fawn


1810

like it's throwing a party
for the bats...
grove of new bamboo


1810

gobble up
my dawn dream...
cuckoo!


1810

morning after morning--
what day is it now
cuckoo?


1810

he's not the type
to wait around...
cuckoo


1810

ten cloudy days--
this is getting old
cuckoo!


1810

it's New Year's
for the blooming pinks...
"cuckoo!"


1810

wake up, pinks
and plume grass...
"cuckoo!"


1810

you too
should grow old...
cuckoo


1810

cuckoo--
he even scolds
the tree planter


1810

hey cuckoo--
this lake doesn't
belong to me!


1810

in all Musashi Plain
just one...
cuckoo


1810

useless me
useless weeds...
the cuckoo's opinion


1810

he's hated
by the young folk...
the dear cuckoo


1810

I've waited long
for thee
O cuckoo!


1810

come what may
praise Buddha!
mountain cuckoo


1810

cheered on
by a reed thrush
the incompetent thief


1810

a flower big
as an umbrella-hat...
flitting firefly


1810

an arm for a pillow--
though there's nagging
a firefly guest


1810

so quickly they join
the human goblins...
fireflies


1810

the owl
seems to be hooting
for fireflies


1810

shunning
the mountain hermit...
flitting fireflies


1810

though a poor-soiled
province...
such fireflies!


1810

in old age
mosquito-burning
the only great feat


1810

the bell clangs
"Come to mosquito country!
Come! Come!"


1810

swarm of mosquitoes--
a five foot tall
chrysanthemum


1810

mountain hermit--
deep in his sleeve
singing, a cicada


1810

morning rain--
look! next to me
a snail


1810

just as you are
become Buddha!
snail


1810

the potted bamboo
rustles, rustles...
bonito!


1810

simply trust
mountain cuckoo!
summer's first bonito


1810

the tofu vendor comes--
the day flower
blooms


1810

just being alive
I
and the poppy


1810

a vast wheat field
dotted with blooming
peonies


1810

floating leaves, floating leaves
lotus blossom horseflies
feed


1810

after biting the horse
the horsefly hides out...
lotus blossoms


1810

lotuses at their peak
horseflies and mosquitoes
feast


1810

from today on
hear my "Praise Buddha!"
lilies


1810

amid blooming lilies
many, many prayers
to Amida Buddha


1810

quietly the lilies
have bloomed...
a skylark sings


1810

sleeping cow--
at one with the heart
of lilies


1810

lilies blooming
with no one's sanction...
evening


1810

lilies blooming!
giving his all to his song
the skylark


1810

nightingale--
in a floating world nook
ripened barley


1810

blooming in a nook
of ripened barley...
what's that flower?


1810

with all your might
wiggle young bamboo
while you can!


1810

wiggle wiggle
wiggle young bamboo
while you can!


1810

young bamboo--
just two or three days
of youth


1810

for bamboo shoots
a dark night
for bamboo shoots


1810

living apart
from the bamboo shoots...
wildflowers


1810

bamboo shoots--
big brothers, little brothers
growing up


1810

bamboo shoots--
scraggly yellow roses, too
grew overnight


1810

night after night
the gate's bamboo shoots
rise in the world


1810

morning and night
yet still not smoldered...
fresh green leaves


1810

mulberry tree--
tomorrow, tomorrow
your new leaves


1810

deep tree shade--
some bush clover-like grass
in bloom


1810

hard tofu--
amid deutzia blossoms
a farmhouse


1810

the closer I get
to my village, the more pain...
wild roses


1810

little post--
on a cold night
my good luck god


1810

my home village--
Lord Buddha
in the cold night


1810

red-laced straw sandals
pass by too...
autumn evening


1810

red-laced straw sandals
pass by too...
autumn dusk


1810

bickering in the long night
in a nook
of Sumida River


1810

to my rib cage ribs
O the night
is long!


1810

autumn's end--
a big man strolls
along


1810

autumn ends--
already the Buddha
fills Kyoto's sky


1810

trying and trying
to grasp the harvest moon--
toddler


1810

harvest moon--
tonight even you
are busy!


1810

the harvest moon
drifts with the tide...
a little boat


1810

evening falls--
like demons emerging
autumn clouds


1810

autumn rain--
a little sumo wrestler
passes


1810

autumn wind--
he was good-looking too
in olden times


1810

autumn wind--
landing on my belly
a katydid


1810

blades of grass--
lost among the raindrops
autumn dew


1810

in the silver dewdrops
vanishing...
my house


1810

grateful
for the cool, cool air...
evening dew


1810

dewdrops scatter--
the sparrow sings
of next-life enlightenment


1810

amid dewdrops 
of this dewdrop world
a quarrel


1810

amid weeping dewdrops
pigeons coo
"Praise Buddha!"


1810

even viewing dewdrops
an occasion for sake...
this year


1810

a treasure at my gate
pearls
of dew


1810

bell for the ancestors--
in falling dewdrops
it rings


1810

my ancestors--
today too they wander
to points unknown


1810

delighted by bonfires
for the dead...
children


1810

in the grassy meadow
flickering red...
lantern for the dead


1810

a clumsy festival!
my love wrecks her chopsticks
of plume grass


1810

morning-glories
make the fence bloom...
sumo wrestling


1810

sumo wrestler--
for you this maiden
flower


1810

a scarecrow stands--
now the age
of moonlit nights!


1810

where did this cold
come from...
Mr. Scarecrow?

flute melody--
thanking the mountain
scarecrow

the hunter is followed
by a goose

and my bended knees

on holy Jizo's lap!
in his sleeves!

nights growing shorter
a delight...
sweet nostalgia


1812

all the short summer night
hard at work puffing...
Mount Asama


1812

short summer night--
little puff-ball flowers
have bloomed

they say, little clump
of trees

the beards of millet
in good health...

to our ears
just a lot of noise...
the cuckoo

a reed thrush--
Mount Tsukuba
in a corner of the sky


1812

to the rhythm
of a moorhen's cries...

in the stone Buddha's

beyond the swarming
mosquitoes, the no-good
nettle tree

one mosquito
flies down my throat...

antler, one
fallen leaf

on my thin legs

is weeping

in pine-tree shade
sleeping, eating...

with the pounding
of a pestle
the mist gathers

has passed away

a pheasant cries--
soup steam wafts over
wild grasses


1813

"The shrine in the field
is too red!"
the pheasant cries


1813

around noon a pheasant
passes through...
the big sitting room


1813

"The crow took
the fried rice!"
the pheasant cries


1813

the evening pheasant's
sleeping place...
a little shrine


1813

the evening pheasant
runs then stops...
grass and sky


1813

clamorous
wild geese who saw Edo
returning home


1813

Zenko Temple, too
quickly passed over...
geese flying north


1813

once again
the deer see them off..
geese flying north


1813

don't go geese!
everywhere it's a floating world
of sorrow


1813

trampling Asakusa's
little Fuji...
a croaking frog


1813

"Hey puppy
come here!" croaks
the frog


1813

in leaves of grass
playing hide-and-seek...
a frog


1813

chin-deep
in the fallen blossoms...
a frog


1813

in his retreat
in the flowering mustard
a croaking frog


1813

enjoying your sex
so shamelessly?
frogs


1813

onto a straw lid
marked "Smallpox"
hops a frog


1813

facing every-which way
frog cousins
and second cousins!


1813

never opening
their mouths in vain...
frogs


1813

at Mokubo Temple
bunking on a flower...
a frog


1813

serene and still
the mountain-viewing
frog


1813

even around here
the world is good!
frogs croaking


1813

my back-alley home--
five feet of sky
but spring butterflies


1813

morning rain--
a butterfly licks
it up


1813

Suruga Road--
even the butterflies dream
about Mount Fuji


1813

weak tea--
every day the butterfly
stops by


1813

tea smoke--
into the butterfly's face
it blows


1813

a butterfly comes
to my good-for-nothing
hut


1813

amid butterflies
little butterflies
mountain home


1813

a butterfly, a cat
deep asleep...
temple sitting room


1813

an arm for a pillow--
every day the butterfly
visits


1813

lending it
to the sleeping butterfly...
my knee


1813

stray cat
look! the butterfly's
well-behaved


1813

stuck to the dog
curled asleep...
a butterfly


1813

mountain bees
buzz-buzz pass through
the temple room


1813

the big crane walks
with great importance...
violets


1813

hopping over the river
of blooming violets...
pretty woman


1813

like playing cards
these blossoms of rape
at the gate


1813

even the bracken
are like nails...
Kyoto


1813

in grassy shade
looking like canes...
the bracken


1813

for Toribe Field's
holy Jizo...
bracken


1813

even wild rose buds--
all eaten
by people


1813

Kamakura--
who planted these camellias
in olden times?


1813

plum blossom scent--
a house with four walls
can't be found


1813

plum blossom scent--
the voices of children
sound reverent


1813

plum blossoms--
the candy nightingale
opens his mouth


1813

plum blossoms--
riding a dog
the Peach Boy


1813

secluded house--
enough plum blossoms
for brewing tea


1813

nothing special
to the village dog...
plum blossoms


1813

snatched
by the stray cat...
plum blossoms


1813

plum blossoms
of the field dropped...
naughty dog


1813

someone chanting
the Lotus Sutra...
plum blossoms


1813

waterfall's mist--
even here, off to the side
blossom clouds


1813

tucking himself in
under fallen blossoms
puppy


1813

in scattering blossoms
holding their breath...
sea gulls


1813

fallen blossoms--
the stylish woman leaves
her butt print


1813

riding in a palanquin
the blossom thief!
blossom thief!


1813

blossoming mountain--
come out and play
devil in me!


1813

the old fence too
has Third Month, 10th day
blossoms!


1813

donning my umbrella-hat--
cherry blossoms portend
a lucky day


1813

sticking, sticking
to paper umbrellas...
cherry blossoms


1813

lining the bottom
of the trash can...
cherry blossoms


1813

the cherry blossoms fall--
I apologize to a dog
in passing


1813

cherry blossoms
I waited and waited for...
I'm alone


1813

while viewing mountain
cherry blossoms...
a prayer


1813

evening cherry blossoms
to the prayer gong's beat
scatter


1813

from willow tree
from plum tree comes
the fox!


1813

from the willow
a ghost attacks!
the child


1813

summer night--
like a lump of fried rice
Mount Fuji


1813

dewdrops spilling--
suddenly the nights
grow short


1813

in the middle of the short
summer night blooming...
azaleas


1813

short summer night--
sister's silkworms
in a feeding frenzy


1813

short summer night--
the silkworms' mouths
chomping


1813

short summer night--
the hairdresser's wildflowers
blooming


1813

short summer night--
an umbrella-shaped flower
has bloomed


1813

in the short summer night
wriggling to climax...
maiden flowers


1813

short summer night--
the frogs croaking
trash talk


1813

the flower that looks
like a wind-chime blooms...
the heat


1813

oh cool cool
evening!
the month's last day


1813

it's a down, down
downtrodden land...
but cool!


1813

the cool, windy moon
is shut out too...
thatched hut


1813

what cool air--
snow and ice
two cents apiece


1813

in the cool air
me and flame-drawn
katydid


1813

cool air--
the evening mountain
becomes itself


1813

cool air--
like pillows beyond the gate
the mountains


1813

cool air--
again from the west
an evening shower


1813

cool air--
a moonlit night fit
for a god


1813

lying spread-eagle
cool
lonely


1813

nothing at all
but a calm heart
and cool air


1813

two blades of grass
cheer for the cloudburst
I bring


1813

blessings fall
on Mount Togakushi...
a cloudburst


1813

little straw mat--
the cloudburst just a spurt
but a good one


1813

perfectly round
the cloud's first
burst


1813

taking the cloudburst's
place
just teardrops


1813

a bowl to catch
the cloudburst...
my hut


1813

a summer rainstorm--
scratches
my itch

1813

a good omen--
in the west, deep red
billowing clouds


1813

on the tips
of my outstretched toes...
billowing clouds


1813

noontime--
about pillow high
the billowing clouds


1813

the swimming flea
thinks to reach them...
peaks of clouds


1813

vain clouds
forming vain peaks
in vain


1813

watching the clouds
drifting to sleep...
summer mountain


1813

the nightingale's
good karma overflows...
pure water


1813

from the azaleas
the azaleas' pure
water


1813

flimsily
the morning-glories bloom...
pure water


1813

mountain village--
even the horse bathes
in pure water


1813

new red flowers
have bloomed...
pure water over moss


1813

at my home
Shinano's moon
and pure water!


1813

at the gate
a palm-sized rice field too
has greened


1813

my portion of rice field
turns green too...
evening's wooden drum


1813

my side-field of rice--
the first to turn
green! green!


1813

even under the eaves
human handiwork...
a green rice field


1813

festival--
for whose treasured child
this red fan?


1813

festival--
snapping my fan
wore me out


1813

a flower shaped
like a Bon lantern...
purification ritual

the sea gull
is an old devotee...

1813

are you renting a home
sea gull?

1813

night fishing--
on St. Jizo's lap
a short sword


1813

moonlight nook--
from the pine's shadow
night fishing


1813

cormorant boat--
her children cry in the window
left behind


1813

sweat drops from cows
from horses...
blades of grass


1813

growing old--
one drop of sweat
soon, another


1813

this day perhaps
even I'll do it...
new summer robe


1813

in our new summer robes
the gate's nettle tree
and me


1813

the first and best
of Shitaya Ward...
in summer kimono


1813

with a face like he's licked
persimmon paper...
a new summer robe


1813

hating the "four"
of Fourth Month...
the change to summer clothes


1813

stretching out
the hand's wrinkles...
a new summer robe


1813

letting white cloud
into the sleeves...
summer robe


1813

waterfall's mist
crawls into my sleeves...

in his summer kimono
more and more square...

1813

my home village--
dangling into the mosquito net
wildflowers


1813

festival day--
some treasured child's
red fan


1813

western mountains--
I'm off to play paper fan gliders
under the moon


1813

shading
Mr. Long-Beard's eyes...
a paper fan from Kyoto


1813

like a belt encircling
the mountain's hips...
smudge pot smoke


1813

the smudge pot smoke
is a comfort...
my life alone


1813

my home village--
the smudge pots trailing
mist


1813

even water sprinkled
at the gate costs money...
life in Edo


1813

airing out the bedding--
atop the futon
a katydid


1813

at dawn
cool air is restored...
my house


1813

this evening's
cooling off...
not quite flawless


1813

cool air at the gate--
the evening isn't
soot-grimed


1813

just me
and a stalk of bamboo...
evening cool


1813

feeding on
Old Basho's legs...
evening cool


1813

night after night
this is true Kyoto!
cooling at the gate

the mountain hermit
under a bundle of snow
Kyoto-bound

the one-foot waterfall
is also cool...
sweet jelly


1813

little tub--
on top of Mount Fuji
sweet jelly


1813

traveler--
on a mountain he sits
with sweet jelly


1813

from a tub
of sweet jelly it flows...
Minano River


1813

sweet jelly
along with the plume grass
sways


1813

the moon like a tub
has risen...
"cuckoo!"


1813

how many gallons
of Edo's rain did you drink?
cuckoo


1813

almost spitting distance
to Edo, eh?
cuckoo


1813

Kiso Mountains--
plowing through the snow
a cuckoo


1813

a little smoke
makes a cloud...
"cuckoo!"


1813

the young buck's
antlers tilting...
"cuckoo!"


1813

I hope your busy-ness
isn't contagious
cuckoo!


1813

which, oh which
is your mountain?
cuckoo


1813

heard so rarely
makes it precious...
"cuckoo!"


1813

even you
have "flea-spotting eyes"...
cuckoo

are you half-asleep?
foolish cuckoo
foolish crow


1813

are you half-asleep?
prostitute quarter
cuckoo


1813

are you all half-sleeping?
prostitute, horse
cuckoo?


1813

cuckoo--
the rain of Great Edo
is sweet!


1813

cuckoo--
you know when it's time
to run


1813

hey cuckoo--
are you scolding
the loafer?


1813

cuckoo--
hot tub steam stirs
as does the grass


1813

don't suffocate
from the hermit's pipe smoke!
cuckoo


1813

are you trying not to
look at my hut?
cuckoo

in a previous
life, my cousin?

pass your solitude
to me...

so my hut
is your favorite!

the raftsman
has had his fill...
fireflies

on the raftsman's chopstick
once again...
firefly


1813

thatched house--
catching and releasing
fireflies


1813

from the plume grass
from the pine
fireflies! fireflies!


1813

an arm for a pillow--
from the nape of my neck
a firefly flits


1813

old wall--
for no particular reason
fireflies visit


1813

he flips a page
of the Lotus Sutra...
a firefly flies


1813

Mokubo Temple--
the dog calls, too
fireflies come


1813

don't go, firefly!
even at night Kyoto
is noisy


1813

go away, firefly!
the teapot's mouth
gapes


1813

my dwelling--
mingling with the mice
pretty fireflies


1813

mosquito larvae--
in a day how many
ups and downs?


1813

amid the buzz of mosquitoes
a bit of red...
wildflower


1813

into the mosquito swarm
take care! take care!
swallow


1813

mosquito swarm--
into my sleeve
they rise


1813

comparing butts
in Kannon's temple...
mosquitoes


1813

where there's people
there's mosquitoes...
admiring the willow


1813

my hut's flies
come along too...
returning home


1813

pesky flea
caught in my hand
become a Buddha!


1813

dawn--
to Fuji! to Fuji!
fleas jumping off


1813

the gate's nettle tree
catches fleas
from people


1813

grassy meadow--
the flea jumps
to points unknown


1813

tired of walking
on my wrinkled arm
the flea jumps


1813

hop off, fleas
and see
Matsushima


1813

even flea bites
on the young
are pretty


1813

held in contempt
by fleas and flies...
today too ends


1813

bloated flea
are you walking it off?
up a tree

a skinny flea
makes a healthy ruckus...
mountain home


1813

a good day, eh?

and hopping

the snail-Buddha
curls up
to sleep

has written
"10"!

why
such careful consideration
snail?

my home village--
Buddha's face
on the snail


1813

in evening moonlight
going bare-chested...
snail


1813

my soybean prayer beads
click and clack...
blooming poppies


1813

like a cow
the bee buzzes...
a peony


1813

looking pleased
sidelong glances
at the peony

alongside
the beggar's pillow...

the toddlers
put them in sake cups...
lotus blossoms

in heat shimmers
at their peak...
this year's bamboo

"O great Japan!
O world!"
the rustling young bamboo


1813

well, moon
now you have young pines!
young bamboo!


1813

play, pigeons
in my young bamboo!
young bamboo!


1813

it's called "young bamboo"
for one night only...
or two


1813

among the young bamboo
not a single one
flawless


1813

for the young bamboo
bold and fresh
green leaves


1813

young bamboo--
the blind dragonfly
carousing


1813

pretty--
the bitter bamboo shoots
swishing


1813

life in seclusion--
guarding the growing
bamboo shoots

shoots of new bamboo--
not one of them
looks healthy

in leafy shade
curled up with a melon...

eyes, melons
cooling in water

just one's enough
for deep, cool shade...

1813

a long day--
Holy Binzuru and blossoms
of Sleeping Tree


1813

deutzia blossoms--
on the road to Fushimi
a dog


1813

nippy weather--
the meaning of "parent"
sinks in


1813

does the monkey understand
"morning cold"?
a little nod


1813

I rub, rub my ribs
still the night
is cold


1813

oh Goddess of Mercy
from this cold night
deliver me!


1813

from the pigeon coop
a head pokes out...
a cold night


1813

night after night
the bug-eating bugs'
cold voices


1813

bamboo in the window
stirs, night's cold
begins


1813

on Ryogoku Bridge
in both directions...
the cold night


1813

a rain cloud
hides the mountain...
a cold night


1813

now I watch
with careful attention...

since the day I knew
the word "Parent"...

my arms and legs
thin as nails...
autumn dusk

the god of death
has passed me over...
autumn dusk


1813

at my hut too
the night turns long...
bottoms up!


1813

night at my hut--
this sinful oversleeping
weighs heavily!


1813

feeling afraid--
nights of so much sleep
are sinful!


1813

wooden clogs
clomp! clomp!
a long, weary night


1813

for you lice
is the night long?
is it lonely?


1813

long!
the night is long!
"Praise Amida..."


1813

a long night--
the devil in me
torments me


1813

"Praise Buddha!
Praise Buddha!"
it's a long night

for you fleas
the night must be long...
and lonely?


1813

stray cat
all the long night is this your job?
yowling nearby


1813

thippity thump!
the fleas this long night
in a fine mood


1813

practicing calligraphy
on my belly...
a long night


1813

from tomorrow on
it's a winter sky...
butterflies, dragonflies!


1813

do you also know
that autumn's ending?
the monkey nods


1813

even plume grass
waves farewell, farewell...
to autumn


1813

looking pretty
in a hole in the paper door...
Milky Way


1813

"Gimme that moon!"
cries the crying
child

the sickle moon
all clouded over...
when I go out

going out
going back in

and a crow raise a ruckus...

in morning dew
a reaching-the-Pure-Land
lesson

potato leaf--
a rice bowl's worth
of dew!

a shiver
runs up my spine...
dew dripping down


1813

Echigo horse--
sweeping away the evening dew
in passing


1813

among the dewdrops
the butterfly's mood
improves


1813

silver dewdrops
and my companion...
sharp shadows


1813

sucking up
all the dewdrops...
my thatched hut


1813

dewdrops scatter--
soon enough
there go I


1813

dewdrops scatter--
done with this crappy
world

beads of dew
when did you sneak in?

the mountain fog
rushes through...

of plume grass

the morning-glories
bloom so briefly...

1813

field by my hut--
no thank-you offering
for the scarecrow


1813

in the rain shower
with a runny nose...
scarecrow


1813

the nettle tree looks
like a far-off mountain...
evening cloth-pounding


1813

my neighbor and I
have an understanding...
evening cloth-pounding


1813

imitating
the owl's hoots...
pounding cloth


1813

the young buck
craps in the bush clover
and moves on


1813

leasing his antler
to the cicada...
the young buck


1813

don't cry, geese--
everywhere, the same
floating world

geese flying south--
the ducks at the gate
cheer them on

in the Future Buddha
he trusts

by the dragonfly...

O dragonfly turned
so red

scolding the cricket
in my sleep...

1813

the crickets raise
a ruckus...
another month ends

inside the broom
I'm sweeping with...
a katydid


1813

you be good
and guard the house...

1813

up to today
such a healthy singer...

1813

the grain grinder
gives it a scolding...

1813

still no wife
his voice grows hoarse...
katydid


1813

on the bridge pile
smeared with mud...
katydid


1813

do you think my head's
grass?

1813

the emaciated grass
totters
into bloom


1813

it's the horseflies'
playground...

1813

chrysanthemum blooming
horse-dung mountain...
one scene


1813

evening--
he wipes horse dung off his hand
with a chrysanthemum


1813

morning-glories--
every morning the fleas'
hideout


1813

with one branch
it blocks the gate...
bush clover


1813

secluded house--
trusting in the Buddha
rice plants bloom


1813

old thicket--
a nook of rice
five or six feet tall


1813

more cutting than my hut's
old sword...
plume grass


1813

persimmon tree--
the color of gold coins
its leaves


1813

persimmon leaves--
once they turn crimson
game over


1813

after great effort
picking the big chestnut...
a wormhole


1813

grassy meadow--
letting the child harvest one
chestnut


1813

worm-eaten--
the best chestnut!
the best!


1813

in mountain shade
rest without a care!
nut-less chestnut tree


1813

it's so pretty!
so pretty!
the poison mushroom


1813

watch out, kids!
don't let those red mushrooms
cast a spell


1813

now and then
on the post of my hut...
gathering mushrooms


1813

coating
the red leaf...
the cold


1813

in my thatched hut
even dreaming
the cold


1813

dawn--
round as the moon
the tossed-out ice


1813

a nightingale makes his rounds
eave to eave...
a spring day in winter


1813

today too, today too
on a spring day in winter
a pheasant


1813

the gray starling
rushes his song...
a spring day in winter


1813

heron on a post--
how is your year
ending?


1813

end quickly!
this year, you've been
an evil one


1813

the owl's year
is running out...
atop the pole


1813

misty--
the year's last day
Kan-ei Temple


1813

what will be, will be--
on the year's last day
I sleep


1813

evening of the year's
last day...
flitting snow

for our sake enduring
the winter rain...

winter rain--
I meet my hut's cat
at the door

winter rain--
the night fisherman
with his mother


1813

thatched hut--
the chrysanthemum hit first
by winter rain


1813

spelling "Japan"
in the sand...
the winter rain


1813

taking aim
at the blooming cockscomb...
slanting winter rain


1813

the cotton bolls burst
in secret...
winter rain


1813

winter wind--
wearing a straw bag
on Mount Hakone


1813

rented house--
the village's best spot
for basking in the winter sun


1813

first snowfall--
like my worst enemy
damn you!


1813

the year's first snow
all trampled...
by the crows


1813

the first snow
makes fried rice balls...
of mountains


1813

first snowfall--
bordering the outhouse
Sumida River


1813

first snowfall--
in the tree's shade
a Shinto flute


1813

"First snowfall!"
and then, soon enough
three or four feet


1813

first snowfall
on irises in the eaves
softly, softly


1813

looking delicious
the snow flitting softly
softly


1813

chop-chopping
a mountain of snow...
a man alone


1813

a big snow--
straight above me
the Milky Way


1813

deep snow--
on the signpost
a crow caws


1813

heavy snow--
from the dinner tray's edge
Echigo mountains


1813

geese and gulls
raise a ruckus...
"It's my snow!"


1813

by the light of the snow
under the window...
gambling


1813

falling snow--
yesterday it wasn't there
"Empty House" sign


1813

snowy night--
near the hut of reeds
Milky Way


1813

my village bell
heard maybe, deep
in the snow


1813

fall, hailstones!
with pillow on his head
a child


1813

falling on Kumasaka's
great halberd...
hailstones


1813

for the blooming cockscomb
thirty cudgels...
hailstones


1813

come! come!
counting hailstones
as they fall


1813

a serving tray for the bride
on the little straw mat...
hailstones


1813

hailstones--
look! there's one behind
brother's ear


1813

the child hugs
her cloth monkey...
hailstorm


1813

hailstones falling--
the paper dog, too
going nuts!


1813

one falls smack
amid the marsh tits...
hailstones


1813

smacking the side
of Morito's face...
hailstone


1813

the big chrysanthemum
wears a straw hat...
falling sleet


1813

the gatekeeper sweeps
a pile with his foot...
sleet


1813

up to my doorway
so quickly the fields
have withered


1813

at dawn by the plum tree
there's one too...
a monk beats his bowl


1813

Great Japan!
a bird recites a sutra
a monk beats a bowl


1813

admirable!
he beats the gourd
non-stop


1813

a cold, clear night--
a winter prayer for the plum tree
too


1813

two sleep
at the edge of the hearth
their pillows


1813

daybreak--
Amida Buddha's soot
is swept


1813

my hut's soot--
I go through the motion
of sweeping it


1813

sparrows at the gate
beg for rice...
soot-sweeping


1813

the daffodil too
covered with soot
stands


1813

soot sweeping--
even the turtle by the pond
gets swiped


1813

sweeping soot--
off daffodil, plum blossom
camellia


1813

dumping soot in a thicket--
daffodils, plum blossoms
camellias


1813

soot and dust dumping--
I bow to plum blossoms
and camellias


1813

mountain village--
soot-covered plum blossoms
and camellias


1813

my hut--
I'll get to the bamboo soot-broom
by and by


1813

remote field--
hidden in trees, here too
Twelfth Month singers


1813

Twelfth Month singers--
don't kick that baby
to the rear!

1813

women also
are Twelfth Month singers...
our Great Age!

the next batch of rice cakes
is for the crow...
Saiho Temple


1813

on the rice cake tub
a nightingale!
nightingale!


1813

on the rice cake tub
the nightingale perches
again


1813

pounding rice cakes--
from the eaves a crow
sticks out his head


1813

my child can almost
carry them...
rice cakes for the neighbors


1813

to my home
he seemed to be coming...
neighbor with rice cakes


1813

in the shade
of the rice cake flower...
making baby laugh


1813

next in line
the cat...
gifts of new clothes

lucky pickled plums...
yet no teeth


1813

after the demons
have all gone...
bright moon


1813

a toothless mouth cries
"Luck indoors!"


1813

driving demons
into the darkness...
laughing

"From this tree on
am I in Nara?"
woman in a paper robe


1813

well suited--
down the slope they go
in paper robes


1813

row of houses--
the people in paper robes
hard to count


1813

playing with the god's
sacred monkeys...
paper robe


1813

like in old China
to Yoshino they go...
paper robes


1813

a face pokes out
the winter quilt...
"Hey, vegetable man!"


1813

fool cat--
yet he knows which futon
is his


1813

won't be long now
I'll hear the wild geese...
futon


1813

the man who left
slept in a ball...
futon


1813

tucking into my futon
just like Dharma
I sit


1813

tucking into my futon
tomorrow's straw sandals
by the pillow


1813

my eyes glaring, glaring--
just like Dharma
in my futon


1813

waking up
to a row of dolls...
my futon


1813

my last resort--
I borrow the cat's
futon

with snow I make
Lord Buddha


1813

he rolls thin snow
into a Buddha...
the child


1813

a sparrow chirping
in his lap...
snow Buddha


1813

growing old too
I trust in a Buddha
of snow


1813

ashamed--
even a child has made
a snow Buddha


1813

first snow--
making a Buddha of you
is hard too


1813

the snow Buddha
likes the puppy
it seems


1813

grow old
at my gate, if you wish...
snow Buddha


1813

naughty child--
instead of his chores
a snow Buddha


1813

my snowball--
the horse
ate it


1813

to the beat
of the snowballs
he tumbles


1813

hurled, it lands
in my sleeve...
a snowball


1813

until the big chrysanthemum's
completely gobbled...
my winter seclusion


1813

he's called
the mum-gobbling bug...
winter seclusion


1813

in Great Japan
women do it too...
winter seclusion

are my neighbors...

line of sight...
a little thicket


1813

winter seclusion--
some little pest nibbles
my chrysanthemum


1813

come, sparrows!
get warm at my brazier
I'm a great hero!


1813

in my previous life
good seeds were sown...
my cozy brazier!


1813

on a clear morning
the coal fire in a crackling
mood


1813

more than enough
for Priest Issa...
one bag of coal


1813

morning's charcoal fire--
the mountain's pine breeze
wafting by


1813

whether upright
or crooked it's the same...
charcoal fire


1813

my pestle, too
for pounding charcoal
has grown old


1813

groping for it
to feed the fire...
coal dust


1813

for one person
it's more than enough...
gathered charcoal


1813

Fukagawa--
one measure of charcoal too
on the ferry


1813

good luck god
come live here, please!
morning's charcoal fire


1813

"O Fudaraku
where waves pound the shore..."
winter's first charcoal fire


1813

though crooked
it's quite a sight...
morning's charcoal fire


1813

in the waiting time
even the dog won't come...
morning's charcoal fire


1813

stuck
to the fish-skewer
a bag of charcoal


1813

the cherry tree
that made blossom clouds
becomes charcoal


1813

the charcoal kiln's smoke
puff by puff...
tranquility


1813

charcoal kiln--
the cherry tree becoming
evening smoke


1813

charcoal kiln--
the soon-to-be-cooked
mountain cherry tree


1813

a charcoal kiln smokes--
doesn't feel
like Twelfth Month


1813

look, children!
the old man's charcoal kiln
is smoking


1813

the world today!
even a woman slurps
pufferfish soup


1813

the horse peeks
over his shoulder...
pufferfish soup


1813

no pufferfish soup
for the lackey...
no view of Mount Fuji


1813

pufferfish soup--
turning my back
to Mount Hakone


1813

hey scops owl!
is the year's end
funny to you?


1813

morning after morning
the nightingale's
singing lesson


1813

hey wren!
do you realize
it's the 30th?


1813

coming to count
my lap too...
the wren


1813

the reed house--
even on the pillow
a plover sings


1813

basking in the sun
with holy Jizo...
a plover sings


1813

counting the remains
of Kisa Lagoon...
a singing plover


1813

clutching a piece
of Kisa Lagoon...
a singing plover


1813

the outhouse too
in a famous site...
a plover sings


1813

I hear my father
and mother nagging...
plovers


1813

stop crying!
spring's on its way
foolish plover


1813

chopping dried mustard
another sound on Suma Beach...
singing plovers


1813

today too
keeping perfectly quiet...
little duck


1813

what a pity--
getting used to beans
ducks and gulls


1813

at all the edges
of Great Japan...
waterfowl


1813

Great Japan!
on the country's outskirts, too
waterfowl


1813

are you mad
at the human goblins?
face of the pufferfish


1813

among fallen leaves
cool and aloof...
storehouse


1813

solitude--
under the fallen leaves
my ancestors


1813

frost-killed grass--
behind the wall

1813

in the meshes
of the net daffodils
in bloom

a field full
of daffodils

for them too
a New Year's feast...
pigeons, sparrows

another year
just taking up space...
my life


1814

First Month--
on the crossroads Buddha
a red skullcap


1814

the brushwood fire's smoke
coaxes
spring's first dawn


1814

my spring
is lucky, lucky!
this morning's sky


1814

now a manly wind
blows...
spring island


1814

spring comes simply
with a pale blue
sky


1814

with that moon
and its halo...
spring has come


1814

hot bath steam--
it's become a moonlit
night of spring


1814

at evening
like washed-out ink...
the year's first sky


1814

a drab color
but it's the year's
first sky!


1814

facing fences--
just three feet wide
the year's first sky


1814

among the pines
just a piece of it but still...
the year's first sky!


1814

row of pines--
in patches between trees
the year's first sky


1814

praying the New Year's god
will heal my weak foot...
again


1814

it's tiny
at my farmhouse...
New Year's bonfire


1814

with a cheer
my hut's New Year's decorations
up in smoke


1814

foot of the mountain--
without a cheer
my New Year's bonfire


1814

this world of ours--
so fast the bonfires
burn out


1814

young grasses
young pine...
my New Year's decoration


1814

fresh straw for the garden!
a sparrow dances
a black kite wheels


1814

fresh straw for the garden--
about ten servants
at work

a present, a present
a New Year's present!
her pink cheeks

for New Year's gifts

on one of Edo's
mountains of rubbish...

points them out first...
New Year's herbs

young folk--
even while picking my hut's herbs
they sing

tree by the gate
the year's first bird song
a foolish crow


1814

"Well, spring has come!"
the year's first
crow


1814

an earthen pot
and an earthen puppy...
spring peace


1814

an offering placard
in the farm field...
a long day


1814

in a thorn patch
some paper, to and fro...
a long day


1814

holding a spear
riding a horse...
a long day

crawl after the departing
spring!

remembering
to fall again...

like a proper guest
the dog falls in...

is falling

behind the thicket
an offering box...
spring rain


1814

for every thicket
every thicket...
spring rain


1814

the horse's paper decorations
feel it first...
spring breeze


1814

with the spring breeze
spring reaches Edo...
the willows!

smoke

from the roof's overhang
dripping, dripping...

over the pole I stuck
in the garden...

misty evening--
out the back door too
Yoshiwara


1814

a custom-made mist
just for it...
nettle tree


1814

gambling in the field
a sermon in the thicket...
one mist


1814

one soars
released from the mist...
nettle tree


1814

snatching a jellied rice cake
in the mist...
crow


1814

even in the mist
my village
is a mess


1814

from the face
of the man yelling for me...
mist


1814

in heat shimmers
the cat snores
deeply


1814

heat shimmers--
off the verandah tumbles
the half-asleep cat


1814

the snow melting
now flows away...
Chikuma River


1814

without fanfare
the great snow has left...
mountain


1814

about ten cooking pots
upside-down...
snow is melting!


1814

the round patches
the square patches...
snow floats away!


1814

in the remote village
snow melting also
is not easy


1814

snow melting
the village brimming over...
with children!


1814

in my province
nothing blooming yet...
spring equinox


1814

across the wide plain
a migrating servant
in a palanquin


1814

every house on the street
celebrates the festival...

1814

today
even in the mountain hut
rice cake for a doll


1814

thatched house--
on the doll's face dripping
rain

a shelf of dolls
and pipe smoke...
one scene


1814

remote village--
they pound rice cakes
for their dolls


1814

oh sake cup
don't go floating away!

1814

the chicken tries
walking on it first...
lid on the sunken hearth


1814

even while yawning
she keeps the tune...
tea picking


1814

Shigaraki--
even the high priest sings
a tea-picking song


1814

in the thicket
behind the house, silence...
no one picking tea


1814

make love, crows
while you can!
burning fields


1814

children and frogs
raise a cheer...
the field on fire


1814

following a cloud
he plows...
the mountain's hip


1814

mocking the farmer
plowing, the strutting
crow


1814

he plows his field
an arm's length away...
sea of grebes


1814

plowing the field--
a shower of mountain
cherry blossoms


1814

such yowling
don't turn to stone!
lover cat


1814

the love-crazed cat
strangely on edge
wanders off


1814

plum trees are eyesores!
cherry trees have thorns!
cats in heat


1814

with a voice
like a temple bell...
the lover cat


1814

the lover cats
bluntly go
their separate ways


1814

the lone orphan sparrow
nice
and plump


1814

come! come here!
digest your food

with me...

in its beak posing...

song, steam
from the Buddha's rice

only an off-the-cuff
song


1814

the nightingale's
"I'm perfect" face...
Kyoto's mountain


1814

the nightingale
flitting about makes his living
in the country


1814

nightingale--
just a run-of-the-mill
face


1814

nightingale--
just a run-of-the-mill
voice


1814

a nightingale--
plum trees in the countryside
should be blooming


1814

a nightingale--
touring the countryside
should be fun


1814

the nightingale
doesn't bow...
plum trees in bloom


1814

nightingales--
country accents, too
in the morning sky


1814

a nightingale wipes
his muddy feet...
plum blossoms

at my window

dangling over
the fresh-planted tree...
a swallow


1814

wake up! wake up! my children--
swallows, pigeons
sparrows

for them

across the shallow river...

as if it just spotted
a star
the pheasant cries


1814

in Holy Binzuru's lap
sound asleep...
a pheasant

sticking their necks
into the temple hall
pheasants sing

they're off to play
in Yoshino...

who'd rather have dumplings
than blossoms

for me

flitting through my hut
forms a cross

guiding the way
to firefly-viewing...

keep the sutra's
rhythm


1815

swatting a fly
on Buddha's holy
head

while I'm away
enjoy your lovemaking

1815

after plastering 
the gate with fleas
the dog runs off


1815

the kitten rubs
her fleas
on the nettle tree


1815

from the pale red flower
a cicada
is born!


1815

mute cicada--
he, too, perfectly
at peace


1815

little monk--
deep in his sleeve
singing, a cicada


1815

drenched
by a rain shower
the cicada's voice


1815

Sumiyoshi--
growing up together
the cicadas sing


1815

cool breeze--
growing up together
the cicadas sing


1815

cicadas singing
it's a contagious
disease


1815

a cicada chirrs--
in the soon-to-be cut
pine tree


1815

cicadas chirr--
cocoons are drying up
drying up

a cicada chirrs--
then flies in a flash
up my sleeve

are you singing for him?

listening to the sutra
is born

make you happy?

while praising the cool breeze
leeches
dropped


1815

speaking
this day's deepest thoughts...
poppies


1815

this world
bristles with thorns...
yet there are lotuses


1815

leftover rice plants--
even the horse
won't gobble them


1815

leftover rice plants--
even the horse
won't trample them


1815

over me
soon enough you'll bloom
moss blossoms


1815

in this world's wind
they thin out quick...
bamboo shoots


1815

one by one
the tall bamboo shoots
bending


1815

bamboo shoots--
big brothers, little brothers
swish, swish!

bamboo shoots sprout
where they sprout

as my melon cooler

with my feet...

from Mr. Wolf
to Mr. Watchman...

1815

I'm forced to play
the flute...
a cold night


1815

by the next room's lamplight
eating my rice...
a cold night


1815

old habit--
the cold nights of Kiso
on my knees


1815

my knees
this cold night in the mountains
feel older


1815

a flute plays--
suddenly night's coldness
begins


1815

feeling for parched beans
with my feet...
a cold night

those who call me "starling"
raise a ruckus...
a cold night


1815

vain mankind
feeling like carousing...
a cold night

walking off
a bellyful of rice cakes...
a cold night

add to the head-count

still
lazy


1815

also behind me

1815

setting the silkworm
moth adrift...

1815

sloppy, yes
but the dewdrops are pearls!
pearls!


1815

"Dewdrops here!"
the coaxing voice
of a mountain crow


1815

to which side
of the silver dew?
the crow's summons


1815

become pearls
great big pearls!
morning dew


1815

darkened by smoke
from the charcoal kiln...

invariably
has neighbors

to pieces...

not an old voice
among them

get in tune
with the others!

slowly, slowly
plover with burnt tail feathers
where to now?


1815

though out of tune
they're Suma Beach's plovers!
plovers!

even in Yoshiwara
in a one-ply wall
plovers in the night

I know! pufferfish's
bloated face

the blooming cockscomb
dies
standing up

among the withered
chrysanthemums...

that hides the lovers...
withers

enough to build a fire...

for a second...

I cheer

snow falls
on the celebration...

decorations

for the celebration
of little pines

tied to the monkey's
back...

of the provincial lord
is bad-mouthed


1816

a kite rises
slow and easy...
a little village


1816

hugging his kite
he sleeps
deep and calm


1816

in one sky--
grand imperial kites
and little kites

a wastepaper kite
next to that of Maeda
Lord Kaga!

its face also
isn't weary

wear noble hats

offer prayers!

melting to the tune
of the New Year's singer...
snow at the gate


1816

the way things are--
in my do-nothing house
the day is long


1816

growing old--
even the long day
brings tears


1816

in the long day
scribbling on a wall...
eyes, nose


1816

in the long day
at my cane's tip...
a fuse cord


1816

the day is long!
long! in this vain
world today


1816

in this vain life
a sheer waste...
the long day


1816

from the tip
of the forest ranger's broom...
spring departs


1816

over the just-spread
sawdust...
spring snow

on fresh-laid reeds
it falls

without a fan

for plow and hoe...

in the field

is just as he is...

vanishing
in the heat shimmers...

1819

relying on
the green willow's shade
cormorant flock


1819

outdoing the cormorant
in skillful imitation...
a child


1819

outdoing the cormorant
with a fine imitation...
a child


1819

cormorants and fishermen--
families
of three


1819

the mother cormorant
raising a ruckus..
her child comes home


1819

baby comorant cries--
his mother returns
to the boat


1819

my favorite cormorant
again floats up
with an empty beak


1819

though sitting
in a new summer robe...
all alone


1819

cedar thatch
for the piss bucket...
new summer robes


1819

watch your head
on that gate!

on their shoulders...

on their shoulders...

1819

this wind
isn't enough, they say...
summer room


1819

pine tree shade--
one straw mat
my summer room


1819

no divine punishment yet--
napping
under the net


1819

even the horses
sleep in light green
mosquito nets!


1819

curling to sleep--
in the paper mosquito net's window
a sickle moon


1819

this body of dust
suits this wispy-soft
paper mosquito net


1819

wringing hands
in the mosquito netting...
let me have just a corner!


1819

the rising moon
in my paper mosquito net's window
passes by


1819

from the beginning
it has hung loose...
my paper mosquito net


1819

while I'm away
hang loose
paper mosquito net


1819

sleeping alone
building castles in the sky...

1819

upon inspection
it's covered with patches...
my mosquito net


1819

up to now
no divine punishment...
siesta


1819

with his elbows
on his abacus...
a siesta


1819

one foot propped
on the lotus leaves...
siesta


1819

after getting it
it's lost so soon...
paper fan


1819

the little blind minstrel
wears it like a hat...

1819

how old
is this little pilgrim?
red paper fan


1819

the little pilgrim
being led by hand...

1819

the little boy
stows it in his neckband...
paper fan


1819

he passes by
like Taro Kaja...
paper fan


1819

picking flowers--
his paper fan stowed
behind his neck


1819

he stows his fan
behind his neck...
little boy


1819

mountain temple--
the little boy's name
on his fan


1819

great temple--
the little boy's name
on his fan


1819

placed to the windward
the prow's
smudge pot


1819

the fish
unaware of the bucket...
cool air at the gate


1819

even green grass
rustles only for money...
cool air at the gate


1819

a one-foot waterfall
splashes too...
evening cool


1819

at dawn
after my second piss...
cool air at the gate


1819

even adding in
a thorn bush, behold!
a cool breeze


1819

dangling one leg
in Paradise...
evening cool


1819

penniless
the green grass unnoticed...
cool air at the gate


1819

lighting my pipe
with an incense stick...
cool air


1819

banging the temple gong
just for fun...
cool air


1819

a doll is made
to bring my tea...
cool air at the gate


1819

one elbow
on a sleeping deer...
evening cool


1819

mother--
while enjoying the cool air
stitching


1819

the stepchild's chore
in the cool air...
beating straw


1819

soaking in cold water
or hot, whichever...
evening cool


1819

as evening falls
even above a sewer...
cool air


1819

the horse too
on rice-planting break...
field by the gate


1819

when your village is done
where next?
rice-planting umbrella-hat


1819

a foreigner watches
the rice planting too...
flutes and drums


1819

the fawn munches
lying on his side...
bush clover blooms


1819

leaping over
a sudden stream
mother deer looks back


1819

hearing people's voices
she hides her fawn...
the doe


1819

noisily demanding
a present...
the fawn


1819

in a hurry?
he's off to see Kyoto
the cuckoo


1819

blossoming deutzia!
plum! cherry!
"cuckoo!"


1819

on a man-made hill
celebrating...
a cuckoo


1819

sing at Mr. Toad's
funeral, hurry
cuckoo!


1819

sing, cuckoo!
you're just about curing
my headache


1819

cuckoo--
"O flies and worms
listen well!"


1819

for my house
a suitable mountain cuckoo
sings his song


1819

"Your praying for rain's
ridiculous!"
reed thrush


1819

just when the calf
has fallen asleep...
the reed thrush sings


1819

just one reed
for the reed thrush...
take heart!


1819

are you predicting rain
in ten days
reed thrush?


1819

the spoonbill takes
a vow of silence...
reed thrush singing


1819

what delicateness!
a snake too sheds
his worldly robe


1819

temple grounds--
a snake too sheds
his worldly robe


1819

world of Buddha's law--
the snake strips
his clothes


1819

lightning flash--
the toad
rubs his head


1819

looking like
"I can ride the fog!"...
a toad


1819

looking like
"I can ride the fog!"...
a crow


1819

with that mouth
he could vomit a cloud...
toad


1819

Mister Toad--
the wife may be waiting
your children crying


1819

a raindrop falls
he rubs his head...
toad


1819

"Allow me to present myself--
I am the toad
of this thicket!"


1819

a big firefly
lightly, nimbly
passes by


1819

his chest heaving
he's chased indoors...
firefly


1819

seeking sanctuary
with a sigh of relief?
first firefly


1819

teasing us
two or three times...
a firefly


1819

first firefly
though the hand is skillful
slips free


1819

first firefly--
uncaught by the hand
flies free


1819

flitting firefly--
uncaught by the hand
uncaught again!


1819

though wrapped in
tissue paper...
a firefly's light


1819

toward people's voices
well, well!
first firefly


1819

firefly lights--
if you keep still
even on your head


1819

do you think my sleeve
is your parent?
fleeing firefly


1819

measured by an inchworm
too...
my house's pillar


1819

today too
mosquito larvae and me
at sunset


1819

today again
mosquito larvae...
tomorrow the same


1819

up to heaven
the mosquito larva flies...
sickle moon


1819

morning's mosquitoes--
behind Amida Buddha
they hide


1819

pesky mosquito--
into an old well
he sneaks


1819

to the lullaby
of mosquitoes
she sleeps


1819

a smattering of mosquitoes--
from today on
an old man's world


1819

this is cute too--
the year's first mosquito's
whiny voice


1819

making even the cherry tree
curse...
mosquitoes


1819

the whining mosquito
also thinks I'm old...
edge of my ear


1819

from the direction
of "all praise to Amida Buddha!"
a mosquito's buzz


1819

a bedroom mosquito's
first buzz
in the flame


1819

a bedroom mosquito
poof!
in the flame


1819

one mosquito
perfectly quiet...
and relentless!


1819

first voice rising
in the evening sky...
a mosquito


1819

where the verandah fly
rubbed his hands...
swat!


1819

secluded house--
even my flies
are few


1819

fly on my umbrella-hat
from today on
a citizen of Edo!


1819

the fly on my umbrella-hat
beats me
inside


1819

a lacquered tray--
whoops!
the fly slips


1819

one man, one fly
one large
sitting room


1819

my home village
where even the flies
bite deep


1819

it's a good world!
one more, help yourself
flies on my rice


1819

in a grassy meadow
she rubs them off...
cat's fleas


1819

don't jump flea!
that's Sumida River
over there


1819

if you jump flea
jump
on the lotus


1819

until the winged ants
come out
a fortunate pillar


1819

"Hey puppy
come here!" sings
a cicada


1819

a cicada chirrs--
the pinwheel so utterly
red


1819

first cicada
"Look at the floating world!
Look! Loo-ook!"


1819

cicada in the pine
how much will you cry
till it's noon?


1819

a mountain cicada--
into my sleeve
he goes


1819

from deep in the temple gong
a chirring
cicada


1819

dayflowers--
even at the ancient priest's
window


1819

day flowers--
burn amid steaming
pebbles


1819

blowing his nose
on the moonflower...
a child


1819

measuring foot by foot
with a fan...
the peony


1819

scrap paper faces
of peonies...
shaded by leaves


1819

sitting on her eggs
the hen admires
the peony


1819

the god of fortune
and luck dwells here...
a peony!


1819

lucky, lucky
luckiest of flowers...
the peony!


1819

even the peony's
good karma wears thin...
my house!


1819

a temple
in the Chinese style...
with peonies!


1819

blooming lotuses
in this world...
bent


1819

it's a better world--
but they're only penny-sized
lotus blossoms


1819

even lotus blossoms
bend a bit...
oh floating world!


1819

transferred to my gate
the little lotus
blossom


1819

blooming pink--
two pennies' worth of water
for your bath


1819

the pink
in the shade of stepmother trees
blooms


1819

even the horse's
hair is done up...
irises


1819

this morning
one's in the trash...
irises


1819

on the blooming duckweed
let us ride...
to that cloud!


1819

in the horse's ladle
the duckweed suddenly
has bloomed!


1819

planted in the garden
of the secluded house...
leftover rice plants


1819

roadside--
even the horse won't eat
the leftover rice plants


1819

secluded house--
using its pillar to thresh
the barley


1819

ripened barley--
with a child on her back
the sardine vendor


1819

a busy time--
even the mountain's moss
in full bloom


1819

the mountain moss
lends a hand
to the blooming


1819

red sacred rope--
the smallpox god's
crop of young bamboo


1819

a splendid, tall
young bamboo!
while I was away


1819

while I was away
just for a while...
a splendid young bamboo!


1819

well, well
pale purple, this year's color...
for young bamboo


1819

it's a good thing
being bitter bamboo...
fresh new shoots


1819

the thousand year
bamboo shoot...
snap! broken


1819

bamboo shoots--
if it weren't for people's "shoots"
you'd live to flower


1819

bitter bamboo shoots--
a lucky
assembly


1819

fancy sitting room--
even peeling melons
an ordeal


1819

first melon of the season
in her grasp...
sleeping child


1819

aligned
with the sickle moon...
the cooling melon


1819

holding it
against her cheek...
muskmelon


1819

a red leaf falls
showing off...
summer trees


1819

making the lawn
a vacation spot...
summer trees


1819

just one branch
helps my siesta...
summer tree


1819

the neighborhood's
relaxation spot...
the tree's deep shade


1819

amid deutzia blossoms
all alone...
a torii gate


1819

amid deutzia blossoms
all alone...
a shrine


1819

with deutzia blossoms
on this lucky day...
outhouse


1819

a deutzia shrub
even without blossoms...
for sale


1819

even the deutzia shrub
is moved to tears...
the toad's grave


1819

reflecting enough moonlight
to light my bedroom...
deutzia blossoms


1819

enough light
to light my bedroom...
deutzia blossoms


1819

first autumn morning--
a fever-curing
kind of sky


1819

a child writes
in the tray's ashes...
a cold night


1819

brushing away
the red horse's hard day...
a cold night


1819

since the day I knew
the word "Parent"...
cold nights


1819

our shameful shadows!
in the cold night walking
in vain


1819

shaking the empty keg
once again...
a cold night


1819

"Here's the outhouse!"
the horse calls...
a cold night


1819

in the mood for loafing
and carousing...
a cold night


1819

bowing to my home village
in my heart...
a cold night


1819

bowing to my children
in my heart...
a cold night


1819

the young folk
sleep together...
a cold night


1819

sweeping dirt
off the horse's back...
autumn dusk


1819

hugging his knees
his face at peace...
autumn dusk


1819

walking on alone
I write on a wall...
autumn dusk


1819

don't leave, geese!
wherever you live
it's autumn's dusk


1819

our shameful shadows!
in the long night walking
in vain


1819

autumn ends--
a man strokes away
his horse's troubles


1819

"Gimme that harvest moon!"
cries the crying
child


1819

guard my hut's key
pine tree!
going moon gazing


1819

a present for me--
moon gazing then locking
my hut


1819

the sake gone
time to buckle down
and moon-gaze


1819

buckwheat country's
sharp tongues cutting...
moon gazing


1819

in my home village
she guards our house...
moon gazing alone


1819

the harvest moon
draws near...
hole in the wall


1819

harvest moon--
fifty-seven years
of traveling autumns


1819

harvest moon--
she'd crawl to my dinner tray
if my child were here


1819

harvest moon--
my lap would be a pillow
if my child were here


1819

harvest moon--
leaving my hut's key
with the pine


1819

little house
in a rice barn's shadow...
here too, moon gazing


1819

Ishiyama--
a harvest moon eclipse
gazer


1819

eclipsed splendidly
as one would expect...
harvest moon


1819

night of the 15th--
a long wait
for darkness


1819

an officious one--
the harvest moon eclipse
gazer


1819

boldy he forecasts
the moon's
full eclipse


1819

in a flash
the moon's sickness
is cured


1819

returning to us
the great harvest moon!
harvest moon!


1819

before the moon does--
the crowd of people
wanes


1819

before the moon does--
people's faces
wane


1819

voices in the dark--
yet this is the night
of harvest moon


1819

to the world of man
the moon deigns
to return


1819

world of man--
even the moon
suffers!


1819

are you the harvest moon's
representative?
white rabbit


1819

the harvest moon
deigns to return...
floating world!


1819

ending the harvest moon
eclipse...
mountain rain


1819

such is our world--
even the moon
gets sick!


1819

the geese too
stuffing their bellies...
Ninth Month moon


1819

stuck in his winnow
chopsticks and a charm...
clear fall weather


1819

autumn wind--
the compass points
to my native mountains


1819

autumn wind--
red flowers she wanted
to pick


1819

pearls of dew--
even on my sleeves
rolling down


1819

a dewdrop pearl--
I pinched it into
a Buddha


1819

trying to pinch
a bead of dew...
a child


1819

this world
is a dewdrop world
yes... but...


1819

dew from a lotus leaf
plenty
for morning tea


1819

on lotus leaves
this world's dewdrops
are warped


1819

on lotus leaves
this world's dewdrops
are bent


1819

across the dried river
lightning
flickers


1819

in the lightning flash
rubbing his head...
toad


1819

in flashes of lightning
crossing the shaky
bridge


1819

lightning flash--
lying in a row at the gate
happy faces


1819

lightning--
streak by streak
cures the world


1819

little straw mat--
even on a one-penny bridge
fog rises


1819

evening fog--
the horse remembers
the bridge's hole


1819

writing the poem
on the mulberry substitute...
leaf of a loofah

of the holy man's hut...

is Mother

to have a child

like snakes

don't carry off
my haiku collection!
deer at my hut

the lazy buck
croons his mating call
lying down

for practice...

a talented one
posed on one foot...
rice field geese


1819

calling a big gang
down to join them...

you too, wild geese
all day, into the night
must travel

on your way

tonight like old times
at Mokubo Temple...

chased away
from the village of people...

in the scarecrow's gut
singing

brave chest, half an inch...
look!

accompanying the cool air...

on her back

sake cups


1819

wielding his hoe
with a face like Shinno's...
chrysanthemums


1819

no drinking at this hut
that's a flaw...
but such chrysanthemums!


1819

if you were small, chrysanthemum
there'd be no shame
of shackles!

happy and peaceful
they bloom...
the riffraff mums

happily they've bloomed
though they took their time...
wild mums

among the provisions
chrysanthemums


1819

peacefully asleep
it has bloomed...

the rice-loaded horse
passes

folds hands in prayer...

never giving up
my field rustles too...

offering a prayer
to Amida Buddha...

holding it
against her cheek...

the bell
of evil

celebration


1819

for one penny
one hit on the prayer gong...
how cold it is!


1819

merely the sight
of wolf shit...
how cold it is!

the old banner
flaps in a thicket
in the cold


1819

"A starling from the sticks!"
he taunts...
how cold it is


1819

evening's glow--
the deep, deep red
first ice


1819

at the tip of the pole
paper flapping...
a spring day in winter


1819

come what may
trusting in the Buddha
the year ends

I'm one of you
with my prickly head

chestnuts bounced off
the umbrella-hat gathered...
by the person behind

like cicadas

though there's no child
to beg for them


1821

my rice cakes--
just four quarts' worth
but pounded with a song


1821

in my thatched hut
a gala night...
drinking away the year


1821

enshrined in the alcove--

of sake

just bad dreams
are my fate...
a crow caws

the second one
is redundant...

timing his death
extremely well...
the Buddha


1826

observing well
this world of blossoms...
Buddha dies


1826

a nightingale sings--
the empty palace
his field


1826

the baby swallow's
flying lesson...
off the horse's rump


1826

taming the flesh
he moves through thorns...
a frog


1826

hot tub steam
wafts softly, softly...
as does a butterfly


1826

some of them stick
to people, young grasses
at their peak


1826

cherry blossom shade--
no sleeping for me
feeling afraid


1826

the world today!
umbrella-hatted princes and paupers
blossom viewing


1826

imitating
the menacing dog...
blossom viewing


1826

mountain temple--
below where I sprawl
clouds of blossoms


1826

the price of grain
falls bitterly...
the heat


1826

garden at the gate--
a tailor-made
little cloudburst


1826

through a hole
you can see the lake...
billowing clouds


1826

making mountains rise
in the clouds...
cawing crow


1826

burning trash
in a field...
billowing clouds


1826

less high
than the sins of men... 
peak of a cloud


1826

lacking the good sense
to form billows...
rushing clouds


1826

cleaning the well--
on a stone a bottle
of sacred sake


1826

even cool air basking
not worth the bother...
moon at the gate


1826

safe and sound
in the healing hot spring
my arm's flea


1826

let's go then
into the autumn evening
for our farewells


1826

in my sake cup
down the hatch!
the Milky Way


1826

old wall--
from whichever hole
autumn moon


1826

for the children
rice cakes while they gaze...
almost harvest moon


1826

secluded house--
in the mood tonight
to moon-gaze


1826

harvest moon--
even crabs claim
the name "Taira!"


1826

pretending to watch
the harvest moon...
rice field-gazing


1826

a world-healing
night of the 15th...
moon gazing


1826

river by the gate--
thrown in a corner
the Ninth month moon


1826

dewdrops forming--
when might I become
grass...or a tree?


1826

by Bon lantern light
eating my rice...
naked


1826

Tanabata Night--
the well-behaved children
of beggar-town


1826

looks like he's composing
a "Star Poem"...
the frog


1826

remote village--
among the grave lanterns
a katydid


1826

the puppy walks by
with a hat...
fallen leaf


1826

snow flitting down--
the mountains of Shinano
aren't joking


1826

my beloved cherry tree
cooked too...
making charcoal


1827

New Year's Day--
all of us in a corrupt world's
blossoms


1827

even the cart man
wears a courtier's hat...
plum blossoms


1827

flowing water spells
the character "heart"...
plum blossoms


1827

at the dinner
tray's edge...
a green rice field


1827

he circles his rice field
an open fan tucked
behind


1827

stuttering about
the olden days...
a cuckoo


1827

behind the morning-glories
a hell
of fleas


1827

let it be
let it be! the flea
has children


1827

sweeping fleas
onto the highway...
moonlit night


1827

world of man--
in a little stone field
catching fleas


1827

world of man--
even walking on sand
picking up fleas


1827

on burnt ground
the fleas throw a wild
party


1827

after the fire--
the fleas throw a wild
party


1827

moon in the autumn dawn--
nearing month's end
lantern in the eaves


1827

my home village
at the end of that cloud...
autumn dusk


1827

at the shrine
children sumo wrestlers...
autumn wind


1827

pipe smoke blowing
it tastes like tobacco...
autumn wind


1827

on green reeds
in a row...
Bon Festival Buddhas


1827

bonfires for the dead--
soon they'll burn
for us


1827

dawn of the month's
last day...
for Bon lanterns in the eaves


1827

one dies out
two die out...
lanterns for the dead


1827

after Tanabata Night's
coolness
a hot tub soak


1827

the pony stepping
and crunching...
chestnuts in the field


1827

knocking chestnuts
out of the little garden...
thief cat!


1827

he's also in no mood
to sweep the snow...
scarecrow


1827

even to the approaching dog
"Who's there?"
winter quilt
